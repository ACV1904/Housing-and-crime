# Housing Conditions and Crime
Individual project for the MSc in Data Science and its Applications programme

This project uses data science techniques to study the relationship between crime rates and housing conditions. By employing correlations, linear regression models, cluster analysis and spatial analysis with python this study aims to uncover hidden patterns within large-scale datasets. By analysing factors such as deprivation, tenure, house price and accommodation type, this research seeks to identify some predictors of crime and inform the way people are living in the city. This data-driven approach offers a novel perspective on the complex interplay between crime and housing conditions, providing valuable insights for policymakers and community leaders.


The implementation was done in Jupyter notebook files, 4 of them to prepare the files and 1 to make the analysis with the pre-processed data.

The files used and sources are explained in the file [read_ipynb_files](https://github.com/ACV1904/Housing-conditions-and-crime/blob/main/read_ipynb_files.md)

The maps were visualised in QGIS: [Crime_data-maps](https://github.com/ACV1904/Housing-conditions-and-crime/blob/main/Crime_data-maps.md)
